\chapter{The team of the Megason lab}

The Megason Lab's employee are post-doc researchers. Two domains of expertise are present : Biology and informatics.
The biology team leads researches on the development of zebra fishes,
and the computer team works on developing a program for visualization, segmentation, and tracking of cells adapted to microscopy data.
