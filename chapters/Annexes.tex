\chapter{Scale constrained \\%
Multiscale Laplacien of Gaussian}
\label{annex:MLOG}
This annex describes briefly the scale constrained Multiscale Laplacian of Gaussian, used in~\cite{al2009improved}, for nuclei detection.

\section{Multiscale Laplacian of Gaussian}
The Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter is used to detect blobs of a certain size, in an image. The LoG is a contour detector based on the second derivative, thus, it is very sensitive to noise. The Gaussian filtering operation reduces the sensitivity to noise.
The Multsicale LoG (MLoG), makes this operation more robust by allowing the detection of blobs of various sizes.\\

With \(LoG_{normalized}(p,\sigma)\) the output of the LoG filter, of scale {\({\sigma}\)}  at the pixel {\({p : (p_x, p_y, p_z)}\)};
 \({R_N(p)}\) the output of the MLoG at the pixel {\({p}\)}.
The output of such filter is given by the following equation in two dimensions :
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:multiscaleLoG}
R_N(p) = \underset{\sigma \in [\sigma _{min},\sigma _{max} ] }{argmax} \Big\lbrace LoG_{normalized}(p,\sigma) \ast I(p) \Big\rbrace 
\end{equation}
For more information on multiscale analysis and Laplacian of Gaussian, the reader is referred to \cite{lindeberg1998feature}.


\section{Scale constrained MLoG}

It happens, in the case of very close blobs, that the MLoG focuses on a big scale and outputs a strong signal
for only one blob resulting from the fusion several close blobs.
The provided implementation tries to counter this behaviour by adding a constraint on the scale of the Gaussian at each pixel.
The scale constraint is computed from a "foreground mask" which should include the blobs to be detected. A distance map $ D_{I} $ is then computed from this foreground mask (see \ref{subsec:EuclDistMapDef}). This distance map is used to constrain the scale at each pixel.\\

The new algorithm uses the general equation of MLoG (Eqn(~\ref{eqn:multiscaleLoG})), replacing $\sigma _{min}$ by $\sigma _{contrained}$ with
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ScaleConstraint}
 \sigma _{contrained}(p)= max \Big\lbrace {\sigma _{min},min  \left\lbrace {\sigma _{max} , D_{I}(p)} \right\rbrace} \Big\rbrace  
\end{equation}

We finally have the following equation for the scale constrained MLoG:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ScaleConstraintMLoG}
R_N(p) = \underset{\sigma \in [\sigma _{min},\sigma _{contrained}(p) ] }{argmax} \Big\lbrace LoG_{normalized}(p,\sigma) \ast I(p) \Big\rbrace 
\end{equation}

The application of this method is illustrated figure~\ref{fig:fig:farsightMLOGe}.
For more information on the basis of the scientific method the reader is referred to~\cite{al2009improved}.
